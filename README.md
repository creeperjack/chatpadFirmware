# XBOX chatpad alternative Firmware
Firmware for XBOX360 chatpad, it's a small keypad normally mounted on XBOX360 game controllers for chat. It features quite complete keyboard and has backlight.<br>
It can be used 'as is' but keys not correspond to letters and it should be used with a complex library to get around the limitations. There's also some limitations about backlight and serial speed.<br>
This firmware mod will allow:<br>

- Backlight selectable from serial, autofade with timer also available.
- Correct char map, no need of conversion and library, work 'as is'.
- works with any processor with TTL (3V3) level serial, initial at 9600baud.

Chatpad uses PIC16F883 with internal xtal at 4Mhz, I have used MPLAB to rewrote firmware, PICkit3 programmer(clone) and some wire soldered, I will provide exact where and how, eventually I can provide the chatpad already programmed (black version), I have several unit here from an ebay auction brand new.<br>

commands recognized by chatpad (preliminary):<br>
- 0: turns OFF chatpad backlight
- 1: turns ON  chatpad backlight DIMMED 80%
- 2: turns ON  chatpad backlight DIMMED 50%
- 3: turns ON  chatpad backlight DIMMED 30%
- 4: turns ON  chatpad backlight full
- 5: turns AUTOFADE on
- char 0x9E: enable keypad config
- char 0x9F: disable keypad config
- 6: return * (for testing)<br>

currently features planned for version 1.0:<br>
- Autobaud sensing, need's just a serial call once (car 'U') and it will follow the speed.(TODO)
- Standard ASCII plus extended one, no need of any library.(DONE)
- 4800 baud to 115200 baud communication. (DONE)
- Uses only 2 wires (plus supply), 1 wire if you don't need control backlight. (DONE)
- Backlight with Fade Out and other modes controlled by serial, autofade on at startup. (DONE)
- Automatic Sleep function with serial wakeup. (DONE)
- Special chars for <- ->, for easy use in microcontrollers. (TODO)
- Configuration mode from keypad (disable dy default) enabled by serial, will be saved in EEPROM. (DONE)
- Any special button will not trasmitted to output as the original. (DONE)
- 8Mhz instead of 4Mhz. (DONE)
- Very low sleep mode, Sleep mode already in but this will allow tiny consume. (TODO)
- Written almost entirely in ASM.<br>
To be continued...
